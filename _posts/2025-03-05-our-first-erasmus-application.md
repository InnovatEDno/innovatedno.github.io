We have submitted our first Erasmus+ project application. The project is an Erasmus+ KA2 project focusing on creating appenticeships for young adults with a special interest in cybersecurity. We would be the coordinators on this project, with two partners; [Educational Innovation and Development Academy](http://www.eqo4all.com/) in Estonia and [Special Education Academy](http://specialedacademy.net/) in Turkey.
